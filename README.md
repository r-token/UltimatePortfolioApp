# UltimatePortfolio

My take on Paul Hudson's [Ultimate Portfolio App](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus/ultimate-portfolio-app).

Working through this was a fun exercise to get back up to speed on the latest in iOS and SwiftUI architecture, code cleanliness, testing, documentation, localization/internationalization, accessibility, platform APIs, and plenty more.
